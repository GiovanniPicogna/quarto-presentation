Size measurements, clutch observations, and blood isotope ratios for 344 adult foraging Ad√©lie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo penguins observed on islands in the Palmer Archipelago near Palmer Station, Antarctica.

Data were collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Program.

The goal of the Palmer Penguins dataset is to replace the highly overused Iris dataset for data exploration & visualization.
